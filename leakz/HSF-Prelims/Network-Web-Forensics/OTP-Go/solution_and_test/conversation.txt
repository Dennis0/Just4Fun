Oh, the forests of Timber sure has changed
	But the Owls are still around
Do you have the passcode?
	Yes, I put it in the File.
It's encrypted...What's the password?
	Don't think I can say over this channel
Our protocol is secure
	Fine, fine.
Hurry up with it
	The password is dont_panic
Okay, trying now; it didn't work
	Sorry, let me check again.
Ugh... okay
	Alright, it's d0nT_p@n1C!
Great, that worked
	Awesome
We should end the channel
	Couldn't anyone be sniffing it?
No, I told you it's secure
	What if they figure out the protocol?
Then, they deserve the passcode.
	Whatever, going offline.
Ending transmission then.
	Goodbye.
