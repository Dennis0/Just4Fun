_If you follow the leftmost side, you will reach the real flag._


The GLAD.docx file cannot be opened in Microsoft Word. However, upon using `file`, the docx file is marked as a ZIP archive file. Using `unzip`, the extracted folder reveals that the .docx file was actually a Powerpoint file. The extracted folder, pptx, contains stuff.rar, normal contents of a powerpoint, and a hidden directory named .secret. Within .secret is narnia.cab, chicken.pdf, and nin.ja. `unzip`ping a cabinet file will not work, but using `7z x` will. Within narnia.cab is skinking.wmz, trump.log, HelloWorld.depend, HellowWorld.layout, and main.o. skinking.wmz can be `unzip`ped. Using `file, Doom is a LHa archive file. Extracted properly with `jlha`, a .docx and .zip file should appear. However, `unzip` can be used as well and picks up only on the contents of the .docx file, revealing the flag in a screenshot of a .docx.


42.zip, glad.7z, glad, and deeper.zip are zip bombs.
