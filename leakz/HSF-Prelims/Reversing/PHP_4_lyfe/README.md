obfuscated.php contains php code at the bottom and running it through a php interpreter generates 255 files in the tmp directory. Each file is a decryption of the obfuscated.php file using 0 - 255 xor keys. One of the dropped file also contains the same code. This process is repeated until different code is revealed (obfuscated.php). Reading through this code, it becomes apparent that each variable is given a number which corresponds to a character position in the flag. They will also have to realize that there are `if(0)` conditionals which they have to change to `if(1)`. They also cannot change the file's length as one of the characters is based of a character read from the same file.
