HSF 2015: EXIF Metadata Challenge

Challenge Name: Meta Meta Meta
Points: 150-200

SETUP:
- Populate slow.txt, wrong.txt and right.txt with feedback for the user. If not populated, default messages will be used for each.
- Populate flag.txt with the flag
- _imgs/ needs to be in the same folder as chal.py. If additional images are added, chal.py needs to be updated to know they are there. Can theoretically change this to use glob if too many images are used. _imgs/ also needs to be saved in the webroot (/var/www/html)
- In chal.py, set the TIME_LIMIT and THRESHOLD for the time to give the user and the number they need to get correct to solve.
- In chal.py, set url to be the appropriate IP to serve images from.

RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS:
- Set the port and run the following command:
# socat TCP-LISTEN:{PORT},fork EXEC:./chal.py,pty,stderr,echo=0
- Example:
# socat TCP-LISTEN:45454,fork EXEC:./chal.py,pty,stderr,echo=0
- Make sure Apache is running
# sudo service apache2 start

SOLUTION:
- Send the appropriate value for the specific iamge for each exif tag that is presented.
- Example solution in sol.py
